### 6. Database Operations ✅ 100% PASS (with warnings)

| Test | Status | Details |
|------|--------|---------|
| MongoDB Connection | ✅ PASS | Connected to Atlas cluster |
| User Collection | ✅ PASS | User CRUD operations working |
| Endpoint Collection | ✅ PASS | Endpoint management working |
| WebhookLog Collection | ✅ PASS | Logging operational |
| ApiKey Collection | ✅ PASS | API key management working |
| Database Indexes | ⚠️ WARNING | Duplicate index definitions |

**Warnings Found:**
```
