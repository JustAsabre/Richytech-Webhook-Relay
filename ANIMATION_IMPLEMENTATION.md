## Animation Characteristics

### Timing
- **Fade animations**: 0.6s ease-out
- **Slide animations**: 0.5s ease-out
- **Scale animations**: 0.4s ease-out
- **Stagger delays**: 100-500ms increments

### Motion Design Principles Applied
1. **Directional consistency**: Headers fade down, cards fade up/left/right logically
2. **Staggered reveals**: Multiple cards animate in sequence for visual interest
3. **Interactive feedback**: Hover effects on clickable cards
4. **Performance**: CSS-only animations, hardware-accelerated transforms
5. **Accessibility**: Respects prefers-reduced-motion (can be added if needed)
