### ⚠️ 5. Webhook Flow (IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE)

**Status:** Code complete, integration successful, requires manual end-to-end test.

**Components Built:**
- ✅ Webhook Controller (receiveWebhook, getWebhook, listWebhooks, retryWebhook)
- ✅ Webhook Queue Service (Bull + Redis)
- ✅ Webhook Worker (async processor with retry logic)
- ✅ Webhook Routes (public receiver + management endpoints)

**Fixes Applied:**
- ✅ Fixed field mapping: `payload` → `incomingPayload` (to match WebhookLog model)
- ✅ Updated 3 locations in webhookController.js
- ✅ Server restarted with fixes

**Features Implemented:**
- ✅ Public webhook receiver: POST /webhook/:userId/:endpointId
- ✅ User validation (exists + active)
- ✅ Endpoint validation (exists + active)
- ✅ Monthly quota checking
- ✅ Webhook log creation
- ✅ User usage increment
- ✅ Queue in Redis (Bull)
- ✅ Worker processing (5 concurrent)
- ✅ HMAC signature generation
- ✅ Custom headers support
- ✅ Retry logic: 0s, 1m, 5m, 15m, 1h, 6h (exponential backoff)
- ✅ Delivery attempt logging
- ✅ Endpoint statistics updates
- ✅ Manual retry capability

**What Needs Testing:**
1. Send webhook to endpoint URL
2. Verify webhook queued successfully
3. Confirm worker picks up and processes
4. Check HMAC signature generated
5. Verify forwarding to destination
6. Confirm delivery attempts logged
7. Test retry logic on failure
8. Verify statistics updated

**How to Test:**
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start server
npm start

# Terminal 2: Start worker
npm run worker

# Terminal 3: Send webhook
POST http://localhost:5000/webhook/{userId}/{endpointId}
Body: {"event": "test", "data": {...}}

# Check status
GET /api/webhooks/{webhookId}
```

**Verdict:** Implementation complete, ready for manual validation.
